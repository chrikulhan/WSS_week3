<!--Responsive design: Components on a page can be
rearranged based on the size of the browser that's
viewing the page. (Desktop vs. mobile device or screen size)
-->

<!--Forms are tricky to style professionally.

*Is your focus content and code, rather than design?
*How will your site look on mobile devices?

*Do you just want things to look good quickly?
*Then you can use someone else's CSS
*CSS themes and frameworks: alternative to writing your own CSS
  -Actually, frameworks are alternative to writing all your own CSS,
  you'll usually need to tweak/customize, but the framework will do a
  lot of work for you
*Pre-packaged CSS styles
*Helpful for quickly styling an entire site
*Forms look especially dated without CSS and are time-consuming to style;
  a framework can save a lot of time and result in consistent form styles
  across your site
*Can be customized with your own styles for buttons and forms
*May have extra components - for example, tabs, galleries, carousels, different
navigation browsing elements, etc.
*Some type of grid layout system that allows for responsive design.
*Responsive design - automatically re-organize elements for different
  screen width

***BOOTSTRAP***

Pre-built CSS/JavaScript components to create consistently-styled elements;
more elements than native HTML provides, for example; tabs, dropdown menus…
 http://getbootstrap.com/components/

Responsive Design: can design site in a grid of rows and columns. On a large
 screen, columns are displayed in a row. On a smaller screen, columns start
 stacking within their rows. Layout is changed dynamically as screen size
 changed
 *badges
 *styel buttons
 *carousels (of content, photos, etc.)that would slide left and right with
 buttons
 *drop downs.
 *navigation things to use for your website.

Need to tell the page to download and apply Bootstrap styles
Need to modify elements so the desired Bootstrap styles are applied
  *add a link to that framework CSS in your page's head
  *identify elements you would like to add the custom style to
    -do that by adding a CSS class or classes to the elements
    -there is a list of styles for those classes

<!--**Notes***
--Looking at buttons, there are multiple colors,
a slight "hover" effect that changes the buttons when your pointer crosses them.
Different sizes of buttons, etc.
Also includes examples

*styling a button is the same as styling an input type submit**
For example: the blue Primary button will be styled in that way when you add:
"btn btn-primary" to the submit input.

<input class="btn btn-primary" type="submit"> See above at the submit button^^^

-->
  <!--Adding a class to style the buttons don't add any functionality.
  They are labeled to imply what a user would think when they look at it.
  Red buttons would indicate danger for example.-->
<!--  *******-->

<!--  before:
  <br><label><input type="submit"></label>-->

<!--  after first try:-->
<!--  <br><label><input class="btn btn-primary" type="submit"></label>-->
<!--  now the submit button is blue-->

  <!--  after second try:-->

<!--  <br><label><input class="btn btn-outline-success" type="submit"></label>-->

  <!--  now the submit button is outlined in green and has a hover effect that fills in green-->

<!--  Now to add a margin to the ^^^submit button.-->
<!--  before adding radio button classes:
  <br><label><input class="btn btn-outline-success" type="submit"></label>-->

<!--  after adding classes:-->
  <div>
  <input class="btn btn-outline-success mt-4" type="submit" ></label>

<!--  mt-4= "margin top size 4"-->



<!--Margins and Padding:(timestamp 16:55 video 3) Bootstrap has a set of dimensions:
**If you want consistent spaces across an entire site, you can select
m-1, m-2, m-3, m-4, m-5 for different size margins (margin size 1, etc.)

**find documentation for bootstrap under the left list: utilities/spacing
(www.getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/utilities/spacing)

**If you want to select certain sides, you can use:
-mt-3(any number) for "margin top"
-ml-2(any number) for "margin left"
-mb-2 for margin bottom
-mr-2 for margin right
-mx-2 for margin left and right
-my-2 for margin top and bottom
-blank for classes that set a margin or padding on all 4 sides of an
element.

**you can add to body, form, button, anything...

add class m-3 to the body of your page-->
